 Project Title:
Online Fitness Tracker System

📝 Project Description:
The Online Fitness Tracker is a web-based application designed to help users monitor, track, and improve their fitness and health activities. The system provides a platform for users to set fitness goals, log daily exercises, monitor calorie intake, and track progress over time through interactive dashboards.

In today's fast-paced world, health often takes a backseat. This fitness tracker serves as a virtual personal coach, offering features like personalized workout plans, daily reminders, progress reports, and diet suggestions. Users can register, create their fitness profile, and get real-time updates on their health statistics.

This project uses MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) or any similar tech stack. It emphasizes both front-end (for user interaction) and back-end (for data handling, authentication, and logic).

Allow users to set personal fitness goals (e.g., weight loss, muscle gain, running distance).

Track daily workouts, exercises, and activities.

Log calorie intake and dietary habits.

Provide graphical representations (charts/graphs) of fitness progress.
